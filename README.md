# README.md Generator

  [![License: Unlicense](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Unlicense-blue.svg)](http://unlicense.org/)
  
  ## Description 

    This is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer npm package. This will allow the user to quickly create a professional README for a new project. The links in the Table of Contents section take the viewer to the corresponding section of the README.

    This application generates a high-quality, professional README.md with the title of the project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
    When the application is run in the command line, the user is prompted for the project title, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, and each piece of information is added to the corresponding sections of the README.md file. The user will also be prompted to choose a license from a list of options. A badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a description is added to the license section of the README.
    The Questions section of the README has a link to the creator's GitHub profile and a link to send them an email to reach out with additional questions.
